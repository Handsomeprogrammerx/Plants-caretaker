# Plants-caretaker
This system integrates an NPK sensor, a humidity and temperature sensor (DHT), a soil moisture sensor, water pumps, and a light-dependent resistor (LDR) to monitor vital parameters for plant health. The pumps automatically dispense water or liquid nutrients when sensor readings reach predefined thresholds.
# Highlight skills

-Logic debugging: Integrated all modules to working properly together with a slick code.

-C++ programming: Wrote a custom program through Arduinio IDE that is capable of automatic fertillizing and watering

-Hardware tinkering: Selected and purchased all components by my own. Assembled and wired by meself

# Status
Currently paused â€” preserving the project framework for future applications or upgrades (e.g., more sensors, industrial grade modules, IOT, smart farm).
